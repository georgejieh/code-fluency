# Code Fluency

A personal repository dedicated to maintaining and strengthening my programming skills through deliberate practice.

## Purpose

This repository serves as my coding gymnasium - a place where I consistently exercise my programming muscles to maintain fluency and independence from AI tools. By regularly practicing syntax, algorithms, and problem-solving, I aim to:

- Rebuild muscle memory for core programming concepts
- Maintain the ability to write code fluently without external assistance
- Track my growth across multiple programming languages
- Create a personal reference library for syntax and patterns I use regularly

## Current Focus Areas

- **Python**: Rebuilding fluency with core syntax and standard library

## Future Focus Areas

- **JavaScript**: Learn JavaScript systematically
- **SQL**: Practicing complex query patterns and optimization

## Common Lookup Points

This section tracks syntax and concepts I find myself needing to reference:

### Python
- Comparison chaining (`1 <= number <= 64` vs. `number >= 1 and number <= 64`)
- Exponentiation syntax (`**` not `^` like in Excel)
- Floor division operator (`//`) for getting whole number results
- The syntax for raising errors (`raise ValueError("message")`)
- Range-based for loops syntax (`for square_number in range(1, 65):`)
- Programming approach reminders:
  - Writing elegant, concise implementations instead of verbose, convoluted solutions
  - Recognizing standard patterns instead of overthinking problems
  - Leveraging built-in functions and methods instead of implementing everything manually
  - Using flat structures with early returns instead of nesting multiple conditionals

## New Techniques Learned

This section tracks syntax and concepts I have picked up during my practice:

### Python
- Bitwise operators for efficient calculations (`1 << n` as an alternative to `2 ** n`)
- String methods like `isalnum()` for character type checking
- Using `enumerate()` for cleaner iteration with indexes
- Boolean simplification (using `return condition` instead of verbose conditionals)
- Mathematical optimizations (like using formulas for sum of geometric series)

## Learning Philosophy

"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie

This repository represents my commitment to writing code regularly, even when it's challenging, to maintain the problem-solving muscles that make a programmer effective. Rather than relying on AI to generate solutions, I'm working to strengthen my ability to think algorithmically and express ideas clearly in code.

## Progress Tracking
