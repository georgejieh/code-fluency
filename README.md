# Code Fluency

A personal repository dedicated to maintaining and strengthening my programming skills through deliberate practice.

## Purpose

This repository serves as my coding gymnasium - a place where I consistently exercise my programming muscles to maintain fluency and independence from AI tools. By regularly practicing syntax, algorithms, and problem-solving, I aim to:

- Rebuild muscle memory for core programming concepts
- Maintain the ability to write code fluently without external assistance
- Track my growth across multiple programming languages
- Create a personal reference library for syntax and patterns I use regularly

```

## Current Focus Areas

- **Python**: Rebuilding fluency with core syntax and standard library

## Future Focus Areas

- **JavaScript**: Expanding knowledge of modern JavaScript features
- **SQL**: Practicing complex query patterns and optimization

## Things I Keep Forgetting

This section tracks syntax patterns I frequently need to reference:

### Python
- String methods (`isalnum()`, `strip()`, etc.)
- Loop constructions

## Learning Philosophy

"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie

This repository represents my commitment to writing code regularly, even when it's challenging, to maintain the problem-solving muscles that make a programmer effective. Rather than relying on AI to generate solutions, I'm working to strengthen my ability to think algorithmically and express ideas clearly in code.

## Progress Tracking

| Week | Focus Area | Key Accomplishments |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| 1    | Python Fundamentals | Completed 9 Exercism exercises covering functions, conditionals, string manipulation, and boolean logic |
| 2    | Python Fundamentals | In progress |
